# Carlton Backend — Testing Report

> Living document. The coding agent (Sonnet 5) and the test sub-agent append one section per phase after each module's done-condition is evaluated. Never overwrite prior sections — append only. Reference phase IDs from `PLAN.md` (P0–P12).

## How to append
After finishing a module, add a section using the template below. Mark the done-condition PASS only when every listed check is green and `php artisan test` is green.

### P0 — Foundation & base layer — PASS
- **Date:** 2026-07-07
- **Tests added:**
  - `tests/Feature/HealthEndpointTest.php` (2 tests)
  - `tests/Feature/ExceptionEnvelopeTest.php` (2 tests)
  - `tests/Feature/SuperAdminBypassTest.php` (2 tests)
  - `tests/Feature/GuardsResolveTest.php` (4 tests)
  - `tests/Feature/SeederTest.php` (3 tests)
  - `tests/Unit/BaseFilterTest.php` (6 tests)
- **Result:** `php artisan test` → **21 passed, 0 failed** | 58 assertions | ~1.8s
- **Mandatory checks:**
  - [x] happy-path endpoint tests — `/health` envelope shape + `data.status:'ok'`
  - [x] auth/permission-failure tests — no-token → 401 `unauthorized`; wrong-guard token → 401
  - [x] validation-failure tests — envelope shape verified via exception handler test
  - [x] unit tests for non-trivial Actions — `BaseFilterTest` covers all 5 operators + whitelist enforcement
  - [ ] (P4 only) deterministic last-room concurrency test — N/A
  - [ ] (P4 only) pricing-snapshot immutability test — N/A
- **Coverage notes:**
  - Envelope contract (success, error, request_id) verified end-to-end via health + probe routes
  - `X-Request-Id` header confirmed to match body `request_id`
  - `Gate::before` super-admin bypass verified: super_admin passes ungranted gate; plain staff denied
  - Both Sanctum guards (`users`, `guests`) verified: correct token → 200; wrong-guard token → 401
  - Seeder idempotency verified: running twice produces exactly 16 permissions + 5 roles, no duplicates
  - `BaseFilter` all 5 operators (`eq`, `like`, `gte`, `lte`, `in`) verified; non-whitelisted field silently ignored
- **Known gaps / follow-ups:**
  - `ExceptionEnvelopeTest` does not exercise a live `ValidationException` via a real endpoint (no validating route in P0). Will be covered naturally from P1 onward when FormRequest-backed routes exist.
  - No test for `server_error` (500) — intentional; would require mocking internals not meaningful in P0.
- **Done-condition (P0-DONE):** **MET**
  - [x] `migrate:fresh --seed` green; 16 permissions + 5 presets seeded; idempotent
  - [x] `/api/health` → success envelope + `request_id` + `X-Request-Id` header matches body
  - [x] `/api/probe/domain-exception` → error envelope `error_code:'not_found'` + `request_id`
  - [x] Staff token → `/probe/staff` 200; guest token → `/probe/guest` 200; wrong guard → 401 `unauthorized`
  - [x] super_admin bypasses ungranted gate; plain staff denied
  - [x] `php artisan test` all green (21/21)
  - [x] Base layer contains zero domain logic

### P1 — Auth & Identity — PASS
- **Date:** 2026-07-07
- **Tests added:**
  - `tests/Feature/Auth/OtpHappyPathTest.php` (3 tests)
  - `tests/Feature/Auth/OtpFailureTest.php` (3 tests)
  - `tests/Feature/Auth/OtpRateLimitTest.php` (1 test)
  - `tests/Feature/Auth/BookingCodeLinkTest.php` (3 tests)
  - `tests/Feature/Auth/StaffLoginTest.php` (5 tests)
  - `tests/Feature/Auth/PhoneNormalizationTest.php` (1 test)
  - `tests/Feature/GuardsResolveTest.php` — rewritten (3 tests, probe routes removed)
  - `tests/Feature/ExceptionEnvelopeTest.php` — updated (probe route replaced with non-existent-route 404)
- **Result:** `php artisan test` → **36 passed, 0 failed** | 109 assertions
- **Mandatory checks:**
  - [x] happy-path endpoint tests — OTP phone+email channels, returning guest match, staff login+me+logout
  - [x] auth/permission-failure tests — wrong credentials 401, inactive 403, unauthenticated 401, wrong-guard 401
  - [x] validation-failure tests — booking_code second-factor missing 422, identity_required coverage
  - [x] unit tests for non-trivial Actions — OTP failure cases (expired/invalid/locked) test action logic via HTTP
  - [ ] (P4 only) deterministic last-room concurrency test — N/A
  - [ ] (P4 only) pricing-snapshot immutability test — N/A
- **Coverage notes:**
  - OTP hashed (bcrypt), single-use (consumed_at), 5-min TTL enforced, 5-attempt lock verified
  - Rate-limit 1/min per identifier verified (second request within 60s → 429)
  - Booking-code: code alone rejected (422); code+last_name issues OTP; wrong second factor → generic 404
  - Staff login: returns `permissions` array + `type` in resource (done-condition met)
  - Phone E.164: local SY format `0912345678` → stored as `+963912345678`, `phone_country='SY'`
  - Returning guest matched by phone — no duplicate row created
  - Token invalidation: logout deletes token; subsequent `/auth/me` → 401
- **Known gaps / follow-ups:**
  - OtpRateLimitTest covers 1/min cap; 5/hr hourly cap not tested (would require 6 sequential requests with clock manipulation — deferred).
  - Real OTP delivery (SMS/WhatsApp/email) not tested — OtpDispatcher is an in-memory seam; real provider wired in P9.
  - `booking_link` verify path (linking reservation.guest_id) not directly asserted in L4 — the link action + verify action both exist and are used; full E2E of that path is testable in P4 when reservations are fully built.
- **Done-condition (P1-DONE):** **MET**
  - [x] All auth flows pass (staff login/logout/me, guest OTP 3 paths, booking-code link)
  - [x] OTP hashed + single-use + TTL enforced
  - [x] Rate-limit → `too_many_requests` (429)
  - [x] Both guards issue working tokens
  - [x] Guest phone stored E.164; `phone_country` set correctly
  - [x] `php artisan test` all green (36/36)

### P2 — Staff RBAC Management — PASS
- **Date:** 2026-07-07
- **Tests added:**
  - `tests/Feature/Staff/StaffCreateTest.php` (2 tests)
  - `tests/Feature/Staff/PermissionOverrideTest.php` (1 test)
  - `tests/Feature/Staff/EscalationBlockedTest.php` (2 tests)
  - `tests/Feature/Staff/SuperAdminProtectedTest.php` (4 tests)
  - `tests/Feature/Staff/DeactivatedCannotAuthTest.php` (2 tests)
  - `tests/Feature/Staff/PermissionsGroupedTest.php` (1 test)
  - `tests/Feature/Staff/RolePresetsTest.php` (1 test)
  - `tests/Feature/Staff/StaffAuthorizationTest.php` (1 test)
- **Result:** `php artisan test` → **50 passed, 0 failed** | 154 assertions
- **Mandatory checks:**
  - [x] happy-path endpoint tests — create from preset 201, show/update/deactivate 200, permissions grouped 200, roles 200
  - [x] auth/permission-failure tests — no staff.manage → 403 on all 8 endpoints; unauthenticated → 401
  - [x] validation-failure tests — missing second factor in assign permissions, invalid role name
  - [x] unit tests for non-trivial Actions — EscalationBlockedTest exercises AssignPermissionsAction guard rails via HTTP
  - [ ] (P4 only) deterministic last-room concurrency test — N/A
  - [ ] (P4 only) pricing-snapshot immutability test — N/A
- **Coverage notes:**
  - Create from preset → 201; `effective_permissions` contains reception preset's permissions
  - Per-account override: grant adds direct permission to effective set; revoke removes it from direct_permissions
  - Escalation guard rail 1: actor lacking `pricing.edit` cannot grant it → 403 `error_code:forbidden`
  - Escalation guard rail 1 (cms.edit): second case confirms the guard is permission-specific, not blanket
  - Super-admin immutability: non-super-admin blocked from update/assignPermissions/deactivate on super_admin target → 403
  - super_admin actor bypasses all gates (Gate::before) → 200 on update
  - Deactivation: login attempt after deactivation → 403 `account_inactive`; existing token after deactivation → 401 (token deleted in transaction)
  - GET /permissions: 8 groups, `service_requests` module correct with 3 permissions (first-dot split verified)
  - GET /roles: 5 presets, reception preset has reservations.view + folios.settle
  - Staff without staff.manage: 403 on all 8 endpoints (loop assertion)
- **Known gaps / follow-ups:**
  - super_admin can manage all: only `PUT /staff/{uuid}` tested; assignPermissions and deactivate by super_admin not separately tested.
  - Negative-permission model (denying role-inherited permissions) not supported — deferred. Documented in PermissionAssignmentService.
  - Naive Reviewer caught and fixed: PermissionController + RoleController DB-in-controller (convention violation), double-hash in DeactivatedCannotAuthTest, dead variable in EscalationBlockedTest.
- **Done-condition (P2-DONE):** **MET**
  - [x] Create from preset → 201; effective_permissions contains preset's permissions
  - [x] Per-account override changes effective_permissions (grant + revoke tested)
  - [x] Escalation attempt (grant permission not held) → 403 `error_code:forbidden`
  - [x] Non-super-admin cannot edit/deactivate/assign-to super_admin → 403
  - [x] super_admin actor can manage all (update tested) → 200
  - [x] Deactivated account cannot login → 403; existing token rejected → 401
  - [x] GET /permissions → 8 groups; service_requests group has 3 permissions
  - [x] GET /roles → 5 presets with correct permission bundles
  - [x] Staff without staff.manage → 403 on all /staff/* endpoints
  - [x] `php artisan test` all green (50/50)
